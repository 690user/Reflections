What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git creates the .git hidden directory that holds all the repository
history. we need that to have a version-control of the project.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is the a middle zone between working directory and the repository.
before repositing any files to the repository, we will move them to the stage area,
and we'll use 'git status' to view which files there ready to go to the repository.
