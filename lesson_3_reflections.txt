When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When there is more contributers to the project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Optional scenario: changes might be labeled as unfinished and I'll prefer to wait untill
 it will be completed and only then I'll pull.
